You need to create a simple web application which will use The Star Wars API (https://swapi.co/).

1. Displaying all films/people/planets/species/starships/vehicles on a single page with different tabs
2. Search input with live updates
3. Sort entities by name
4. When click on any entity show the detailed information about
(e.g. click on the film "A New Hope" will show detailed information and all entities in this film(species/starships/vehicles/planets), so you can go recursively through them)
